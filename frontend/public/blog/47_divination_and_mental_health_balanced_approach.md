# Divination and Mental Health: A Balanced Approach

The relationship between divination practices and mental health requires careful consideration of both the potential benefits and risks that spiritual guidance seeking can have on psychological well-being, emotional stability, and overall mental health. While divination can provide valuable insights, comfort, and spiritual support that enhance psychological resilience and personal growth, it can also become problematic when used as a substitute for professional mental health care or when it increases anxiety, dependency, or disconnection from reality. Understanding how to approach divination in ways that support rather than compromise mental health requires developing discernment, maintaining appropriate boundaries, and integrating spiritual practices with comprehensive approaches to psychological well-being and professional mental health support when needed.
