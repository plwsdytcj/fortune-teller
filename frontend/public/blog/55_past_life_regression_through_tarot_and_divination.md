# Past Life Regression Through Tarot and Divination

## Introduction

Past life regression through divination offers a powerful method for exploring soul memories, understanding karmic patterns, and healing deep-seated issues.

Approach past life divination with respect, preparation, and appropriate caution. Focus on healing and empowerment rather than entertainment or ego gratification. Remember that the ultimate goal is not proving past life existence but rather gaining wisdom and healing for your current incarnation.

Trust your intuition while maintaining healthy discernment. Allow the process to unfold naturally without forcing specific outcomes. Most importantly, use any insights gained to become a more loving, wise, and compassionate person in this lifetime.

The soul's journey spans eternity, but your power to choose love, growth, and service exists only in this precious present moment.
