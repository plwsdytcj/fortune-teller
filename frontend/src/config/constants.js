## Name Analysis (Wuge)

Name Wuge is a system of numerology based on names, used to analyze and infer an individual's personality traits, potential, fortune, etc. It believes that each Chinese character has specific sounds, meanings, and shapes. By comprehensively analyzing the five-element attributes, sound numbers, and meanings of each character in a name, it aims to reveal a person's destiny and character.

Name Wuge usually includes the following elements:

- The five-element attributes of the name: Each character corresponds to one of the five elements (Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water). By analyzing the attributes of each character and their relationships, one's five-element characteristics and numerological attributes are inferred.

- Sound numbers: Each Chinese character has a corresponding sound number, i.e., its pronunciation. Based on the sound numbers of each character in the name, combined with the five-element attributes, one's aura, personality tendencies, etc., are inferred.

- Character meanings: Each Chinese character has a unique meaning. By analyzing the meaning of each character in the name, one can understand aspects of an individual's personality, talents, and life path.

- The interplay of the five elements: Based on the principles of mutual generation and overcoming of the five elements, the relationships between characters in a name are analyzed to infer one's five-element balance and destiny trends.

Based on the above elements, the Name Wuge system can provide some predictions and guidance regarding personal character, potential, career, marriage, health, etc. However, it should be noted that Name Wuge is just one method of numerology and does not completely determine a person's destiny. Personal growth and development are also influenced by various other factors, such as individual effort and environment. Therefore, the interpretation of Name Wuge can be taken as a reference and part of self-reflection, but it is not the sole determinant.

## Plum Blossom Divination (Meihua Yishu)

Plum Blossom Divination, also known as Meihua Yi Shu, is an ancient Chinese method of divination used to predict future situations or gain insight into matters. It is based on the principles and symbolic system of the I Ching, combined with mathematical calculations, symbolic meanings, and intuitive perception.

The core of Plum Blossom Divination is the application of the eight trigrams and sixty-four hexagrams. The eight trigrams are the basic symbols in the I Ching, composed of three continuous lines, each of which can be a yang line (solid) or a yin line (broken). The sixty-four hexagrams are formed by various combinations of the eight trigrams, with each hexagram having a specific meaning and symbolism.

In Plum Blossom Divination, a specific hexagram is obtained by tossing three coins or using plum blossom sticks. The interpretation and analysis are then carried out based on the meaning of the hexagram and related explanations. This includes the upper and lower trigrams of the hexagram, the line statements, the judgment, and other factors related to the individual's question or matter.

Plum Blossom Divination is considered a wisdom system that transcends time and space, helping people understand the changes in themselves and the world around them, and providing a method for thinking and decision-making. It has been widely used in history for prediction, decision-making, and numerology, and is regarded as a mystical and useful tool. However, interpreting Plum Blossom Divination requires a certain amount of study and practice, and is usually done by experts or experienced individuals.

## Dream Interpretation (Zhougong Jiemeng)

Zhougong Jiemeng (Duke of Zhou's Interpretation of Dreams) is an ancient Chinese method of dream interpretation, traditionally attributed to the Duke of Zhou (Ji Dan), a famous statesman of the Western Zhou Dynasty and one of its founders. According to legend, the Duke of Zhou had the ability to interpret dreams, understanding the various symbols and images people saw in their sleep and providing corresponding explanations and guidance.

The theoretical basis of Zhougong Jiemeng is to infer the meaning and omens of dreams based on the symbols, plots, and actions within them, believing that dreams are expressions of a person's inner activities and subconscious. According to different dream contents, Zhougong Jiemeng provides corresponding explanations and predictions, helping people understand the information in their dreams and some hints about the future.

Zhougong Jiemeng held an important position in ancient Chinese culture and was widely used in various fields, including politics, officialdom, military, and family life. People often sought predictions and guidance for the future through Zhougong Jiemeng, as well as answers to their inner pursuits and questions.

However, it should be noted that Zhougong Jiemeng falls into the category of folk superstition, and its explanations and predictions have no scientific basis, serving only for entertainment and reference. The interpretation of dreams also needs to be combined with an individual's specific situation and experiences, and one should not excessively rely on dream interpretation results to influence one's decisions and actions.

## Tarot Cards

Tarot cards are a tool of divination originating from Europe, often used for predicting the future, exploring the inner self, and providing guidance. It consists of a deck of 78 cards, each with a specific pattern and symbolic meaning.

Tarot cards are believed to have originated in 15th-century Italy, initially not for divination but as a card game. However, over time, people began to use them for divination and spiritual exploration. Tarot cards gradually became popular in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, becoming an important tool in the spiritual and mystical fields.

A standard deck of Tarot cards consists of two main parts: the Major Arcana and the Minor Arcana. The Major Arcana consists of 22 cards, each representing different symbols and themes, such as fate, strength, and justice. The Minor Arcana contains 56 cards, divided into four suits: Wands, Cups, Swords, and Pentacles, with each suit containing 10 numbered cards and 4 court cards.

When using Tarot cards for divination, the diviner usually draws a certain number of cards from the deck based on the querent's question or purpose and interprets them according to the symbolic meaning of the cards. Each card has a unique meaning, and combined with the diviner's intuition and experience, it can provide insights into the past, present, and future, as well as reflections and guidance on one's inner world.

It is important to note that Tarot cards are not a tool for predicting destiny but offer a way for reflection and guidance. The results and interpretations of a divination can vary depending on the individual's perspective, experience, and intuition. Therefore, when using Tarot cards, one should maintain an open mind and use them as a tool to inspire thought and explore the inner world, rather than treating them as absolute truth.

## Bazi (Eight Characters of Birth)

Bazi calculation is a traditional Chinese numerology method, also known as Eight-Character numerology or Bazi fortune-telling. It is based on the lunar birth date and time, using eight characters to reveal information about an individual's destiny, personality traits, and fortune.

The eight characters refer to the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches of the four units: year, month, day, and hour. The ten Heavenly Stems are Jia, Yi, Bing, Ding, Wu, Ji, Geng, Xin, Ren, Gui. The twelve Earthly Branches are represented by the twelve zodiac animals (Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, Pig). The year pillar is derived from the Heavenly Stem and Earthly Branch of the birth year; the month, day, and hour pillars are derived from their respective Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches.

The process of generating the Bazi involves corresponding calculations and derivations of the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches. Once the Bazi is generated, it can be calculated and interpreted based on the combination and interplay of the eight characters, combined with numerological theory. By analyzing the five-element attributes of the Bazi, the yin-yang balance, and the generating and overcoming relationships of the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches, one can infer characteristics and trends in an individual's life path, career development, marital status, health, etc.

Bazi calculation usually requires professional numerology software, books, or consultation with a numerologist. At the same time, Bazi is a complex field of study that requires in-depth learning and practice for accurate interpretation and understanding. Therefore, when undergoing a Bazi reading, it is advisable to seek the guidance and interpretation of a professional to obtain more accurate results and guidance.
